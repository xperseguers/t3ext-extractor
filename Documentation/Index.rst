    :Description:
        This extension detects and extracts metadata (EXIF / IPTC / XMP / ...) from potentially thousand
        different file types (such as MS Word/Powerpoint/Excel documents, PDF and images) and bring them automatically
        and natively to TYPO3 when uploading assets. Works with built-in PHP functions but takes advantage of Apache
        Tika and other external tools for enhanced metadata extraction.
