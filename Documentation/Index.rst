This extension detects and extracts metadata (EXIF / IPTC / XMP / ...) from
potentially thousand different file types (such as MS Word/Powerpoint/Excel
documents, PDF and images) and bring them automatically and natively to TYPO3
when uploading assets. Works with built-in PHP functions but takes advantage of
Apache Tika and other external tools for enhanced metadata extraction.
