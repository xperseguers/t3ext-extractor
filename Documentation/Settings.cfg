description = This extension detects and extracts metadata (EXIF / IPTC / XMP / ...)
      from potentially thousand different file types (such as MS Word/Powerpoint/Excel
      documents, PDF and images) and bring them automatically and natively to TYPO3
      when uploading assets. Works with built-in PHP functions but takes advantage of
      Apache Tika and other external tools for enhanced metadata extraction.
